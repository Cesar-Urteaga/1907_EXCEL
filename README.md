#  Excel toolbox <img src="./_IMAGES/Logo.png" align="right" height="150"/>

This project contains some Excel's files or VBA macros that I have been developing throughout my professional career that might be useful in manifold tasks regardless of the field.

##  Organization of the Files

The project has the following structure:

  * **_CODES**: It harbors the \*.bas files (i.e., the plain-text files which hold VBA code).
  * **_FORMS**: It contains both the \*.frm and \*.frx files (i.e., the VBA userforms' files).
  * **_WORKBOOKS**: It has the Excel's workbooks of the project.
  * **_IMAGES**: It is just an ancillary folder (please, ignore it).
